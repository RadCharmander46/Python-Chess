# Python-Chess
Chess coded within python using unicode characters and python command line

This was coded in Visual Studio Code from 13/02/24 to 18/02/24. I was bored during midterm break and so decided to do a big project. 

The program itself is dependant on the unicode chess characters for correctly displaying pieces. Additionally if the characters aren't the normal size (2 spaces) the pieces may get misaligned when a row has minimal other pieces. The game can end by checkmate, stalemate or threefold repetition. 50 turn limit, insufficent material,resignation and losing on time are not implemented. 50 turn limit and insufficent material weren't implemented as they would eventually tie to repetition. Resignation wasn't as it is not suitable without network support. Lasty, time wasn't implemented as I did not know how to get another window to run in parrallel. Also unlike the offical rules dictate, a board with an en passant and a board without are counted as a repetition.
